# CBSR EIS Connector
This Java project is inteded to connect the CBSR system to any [EIS](https://github.com/eishub/eis/wiki)-compliant system (mainly the [GOAL](http://goalapl.atlassian.net/wiki) agent programming platform). 

The target 'system' is usually a GOAL agent that controls the entire interaction. A single entity is used that can receive input from the system through percepts and take according action(s). Documentation on the available actions and percepts is available elsewhere.
