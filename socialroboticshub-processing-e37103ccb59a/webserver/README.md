# Web Server
This Python script (and accompanying files) runs a [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) webserver. It responds to several actions from the CBSR system which are in some way rendered on a web page, which can then be shown on e.g. a robot's tablet. Input on a webpage is fed back into the CBSR system (depending on the context). The webserver can also stream audio and video files to a receiving device.

The script is not meant to be executed stand-alone, but is integrated in the CBSR server system.
