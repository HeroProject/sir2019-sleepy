# Web Search
This Python script takes search requests (query and subject) from the CBSR system, runs them through an API (lastfm audioscrobbler, flickr or themoviedb) depending on the input, and feeds a resulting webpage (URL) and accompanying text back into the CBSR system.

The script is not meant to be executed stand-alone, but is integrated in the CBSR server system.
