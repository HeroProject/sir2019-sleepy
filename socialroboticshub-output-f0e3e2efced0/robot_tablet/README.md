# Robot Tablet
These two Python scripts are meant to be copied to a Pepper robot, where it will feed tablet-specific action requests from the CBSR system into the robot's tablet.
These actions are: image, video, control, web, audio, question_yn, question_rate, text, caption, input_name, input_date, input_numbers, input_text, and input_multiple.
